## Hello World! ðŸ’»
I am passionate about web development, focusing on the front-end, but precisely on the Javascript stack (NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native), during my career I have worked with 
various technologies and databases, I am self-taught, I always try to update / specialize with the new technologies of the market and I always try to add value in the project 
and/or with whom I am working, I like to work as a team and I am committed to deadlines and goals, because a person without their goals/objectives is nothing.
 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying bootcamp GoStack at Rocketseat.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript, Node.js, and React Native.
- âš¡ Languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and others...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: tech, series, movies, investments and personal development
